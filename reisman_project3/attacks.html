            <h1>Types of Attacks</h1>
            <h2>Replay Attack</h2>
            <p>
                This attack allows hackers to gain access to controlling the locks on a car.
                When the unlocked button on a key fob is pressed, a modulated radio signal
                is sent to the car. If the signal matches the car, the doors of the car are
                unlocked. To get around this, hackers record the signal and play it
                back to control the locks.

                To fix this, key fobs began using a rolling code system.<br><br><br>
                Security evolved, meaning hacker exploits would also have to evolve to keep up.
            </p><br>
            <h2>Kamkar&rsquo;s Rolljam Attack</h2>
            <p>
                To improve security, a rolling code system uses an algorithm to generate a new
                code every time the unlock button is pressed. The car unlocks because it
                knows the same algorithm. Once a new code is generated, the old code is overriden.
                This was implemented to prevent replay attacks.<br><br><br>
                Kamkar&rsquo;s rolljam attack is implemented by recording and blocking the original radio
                signal sent from the key fob. Blocking the signal means that the car will not unlock.
                Most likely, the unlock button will be pressed again. The second time the unlock button
                is pressed, the hacker will also record and block the signal. The hacker will then
                replay the original recorded signal so that the car will unlock. This attack is so discreet
                that the car owner will likely not realize they are being targeted. The hacker can now
                replay the second recorded code to unlock the car.<br><br><br>
                This hack may seem complicated and unlikely to happen, but if someone really wanted
                access to your car, this device costs

            </p><br>
            <h2>On-Board Diagnostics (OBD-II) Dongle Attack</h2>
            <p>
                Car repair shops use On-Board Diagnostics (OBD-II) dongles to check for problems with cars.
                These dongles plug into a port in the car, making it possible to communicate with the
                car&rsquo;s computer. This is how repair shops diagnose cars.<br><br><br>
                These dongles also have their own vulnerabilities. One is that it is
                possible for hackers to power down a car engine remotely. This attack is possible as long as
                the car is within Bluetooth range. Bluetooth range has been increasing as
                techology has continued to evolve.<br><br><br>
                To help combat the vulnerabilities, a two-step verification has been implemented.
                Hackers found their way past the rolling code system, so it is only a matter of time
                before hackers find a way around two-step verification.
